# IIITD Bleh Mail Filters

> Curated mail filter list to archive the junk IIITD mails

Like me, you (the IIITD student) too are probably tired of seeing the following mails:

* Yoga sessions
* Monday musings
* Webinars/seminar series/math talks
* and a lot more...

The [all-filters.xml](all-filters.xml) holds various rigorous filters that should filter out most of the unwanted mass-mailing-list emails (read spam).

Some of these filters might seem too aggressive, or directed at "valid" emails, but eh, these are majorly my prefs, idc.

**Contributions towards improving the filters are appreciated and required.**

### Use

1. Download the [all-filters.xml](all-filters.xml) file
1. Open Gmail (your IIITD account, no shit) and import it: Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Import filters.
1. Check the filters that you want and "Create filters".

### NB

* I'll be regularly checking the "Bleh" label to ID false positives and tweak the filter rules accordingly.
* Nahi bhai, this hasn't been done using AI, ML, NLP, AR, VR, IoT, blockchain or React Native. I've personally hand-crafted it.
* Fork this and change the filter rules to your tastes if it isn't boding well.

### Disclaimer

Shouldn't need to say it, but **I am not responsible** for missed deadlines, fee payments, awesome wEbiNaRs, yoga sessions, research opportunities or any other type of skipped email. I will expect you to go through all the filters and appropriately judge them for yourself.
